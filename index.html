                <h2>Emancipation</h2>
                <p>This summer breakfast cake is positively bursting with flavor! From the fresh blueberries and lemon zest in the cake to the walnuts and cinnamon sugar in the copious amounts of buttery topping, we’re both thrilled and thankful that chef Adrian Lipscombe shared this recipe with us.</p>

                <h2>Butternut</h2>
                <p>Squash are not the easiest of vegetables to prepare and require a very sharp knife combined with brute force! If you are in a hurry or want to make this soup at a time of year when butternut squash are not in season, you can use frozen butternut squash, which has already chopped into chunks for you.</p>

                <h2>Garlic</h2>
                <p>This dish is wonderful for holidays, weekend dinners, or just when you're looking for something a bit different to throw into the weekly routine. With only seven ingredients, it's not daunting and can be marinated the night before, to make for an easier cooking process.</p>
